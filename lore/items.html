				"Last Days" items list:<p/>
				<hr/>
				<h2>Weapons</h2>
				<h3>Firearm</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Bow</b></div><p/>
				While the name is quite general by our standards it speaks volumes in the wastes. It combines various elements of pre-war weapons technology into a single simplified form. It is used to fire projectiles which are tipped with a metal shard and tailed with a small fuel compartment which is ignited as it is fired. Between the tip and the fuel compartment is a hallow aluminum tube.<p/>
				The Fire Arm is the primary tool of bandits in the waste due to its convenience and surprising accuracy (if assembled correctly).
				<h3>Railgun</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Crossbow</b></div><p/>
				<div class="wip">Under construction!</div>
				<h3>Firearm Projectile</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Arrow</b></div><p/>
				<div class="wip">Under construction!</div>
				<h3>Car Door</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Shield</b></div><p/>
				<div class="wip">Under construction!</div>
				<h3>Scrap Bat</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Wooden Sword</b></div><p/>
				This blunt club hardly deserves its designation as a weapon, as it can't be used for much more than bludgeoning giant rats to death.
				<h3>Lead Pipe</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Stone Sword</b></div><p/>
				A makeshift weapon made out of a few random pipe sections. Hollow on the inside, painfully stable on the outside.
				<h3>K.O. Sledgehammer</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Iron Sword</b></div><p/>
				The K.O. (Knock-O-Matic) is a sledgehammer with a twist! An inbuilt flywheel conserves momentum when the hammer is moved around. Upon impact the force is unleashed in a second burst, allowing more efficent processing of work pieces and alleviated decapitation of foes.
				<h3>Analytic Probe</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Golden Sword</b></div><p/>
				A multi-purpose tool employed by Orbital Industries scientists, mostly to study various factors of the moons environment. While not a weapon per se, it's capable of giving of low current shocks, intended to determine a substances conductance.<p/>
				Single shocks are ignorable for any healthy human, but present a danger when recieved in large dosages. Packs of mutated scientist, bent on probing places where the sun doesn't shine, should not be trifled with…
				<h3>Cattle Prod</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Diamond Sword</b></div><p/>
				For reasons unknown, some big wheel at Orbital decided that all cocoons should be supplied with a set of cattle prods. With no surviving cattle that would tolerate prodding, the prods can be used as a viable weapon when overcharged with uranium power rods.<p/>
				Just don't touch the buzzing end.

				<div class="wip">Under construction!</div>
				<hr/>
				<h2>Armor</h2>
				<h3>Stoneback Leather Armor</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Leather Armor</b></div><p/>
				A crude set of clothing made out of the durable hide of the stoneback, for those prefering survival over fashion.<p/>
				After hunting down and skinning a stoneback, the hide needs to be dryed (and if possible tanned) for some time before it can be processed any further.<p/>
				While the smell of the hapless previous skin-owner never quiet dissipates, the armor protects its wearer from minor injuries and harsh weather (excluding lightning).
				<h3>Metal Armor</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Iron Armor</b></div><p/>
				A set of mixed sports and work protectors, reinforced with iron plating.<p/>
				The chestpieces can be identified as part of a cocoons rugby equipment, the head part is a welder's helmet.<p/>
				While the metal armor is a preferable alternative over the stoneback armor in direct combat, its ragtag design leaves you open to sneak attacks from behind and provides less protection against the elements.<p/>
				Swimming in this heavy armor is also not advised, should you ever come across a pool of clean water.
				<h3>Mk-235 Armor</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Diamond Armor</b></div><p/>
				One of Orbitals more recent developments before the Event, this set of heavy sealed armor provides the wearer with excellent protection against any source of damage*. However it's incredibly hard to come by, let alone, reverse-engineer it.<p/>
				Another problem is the armor's constant need for uranium power rods, otherwise the wearer will be stuck in an unmoving, 200 kg (440 lbs) heavy metal shell, which is quiet a nuisance in a desserted wasteland.<p/>
				The armor should only be worn when needed, otherwise you risk looking like a tool.<p/>
				Oh, and you might contract long-term, third degree radiation burns on the torso and head from the power rods.<p/>
				* The armor is not impervious to sources of concentrated radiation and doesn't come with a rebreather. Go figure.
				<h3>Hazmat Suit</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Golden Armor</b></div><p/>
				In a world plagued by radiation, a protective suit is worth its weight in gold. If only gold was still worth anything.<p/>
				While not the ideal choice for Huggatron hunting, this golden apparel is trusted to protect in irradiated environments, on both the Earth and the Moon!<p/>
				Even today the personel stranded in the Belly still wear a white edition of these suits, keeping them safe from all-<p/>
				Wait... they did mutate, right? Maybe not such a bright idea to invest into a hazmat suit after all...
				<h3>Jane Mail's Armor</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Chainmail Armor</b></div><p/>
				A plagiarism of Orbital Industries Mk-235 armor, created after the Event.<p/>
				Trying to make money of the peoples hysteria, a businesswoman named Jane Mail produced cheap, but impressive looking, replicas and sold them at horrendous prices.<p/>
				While durable, they offered hardly more physical protection than a hadware-store-grade hazmat suit.<p/>
				They are hardly ever seen around the wastes and no one ever tried to rebuild one.
				<hr/>
				<h2>Resources</h2>
				<h3>Rare Metals</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Gold Ingot</b></div><p/>
				Certain rare metals are used to treat radiation poisoning, and that's the reason they're so valuable. On Earth, rare metals can be found in safes deep in H.I.V.E.s. On the Moon, in the irradiated Belly itself, they are more common and stored in the form of dust.<p/>
				These materials is actively used by the surviving Moon scientists to treat radiation. For an extreme traveler, this is a great reason to trade.
				<h3>Rare Metal Dust</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Gold Nugget</b></div><p/>
				A small proportion of rare metals used to create anti-radiation medicines.
				<hr/>
				<h2>Consumable</h2>
				<h3>Jarred Carrot</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Carrot</b></div><p/>
				Unlike carrots of pre-war times, these are more resistant to radiation and are able to absorb the energy supplied by hydronic batteries for faster growth. They can mostly be found in villages of the Masked.
				<h3>Glistering Jarred Carrot</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Golden Carrot</b></div><p/>
				This carrot, soaked in a dose of rare metals, is an ideal cure for radiation. Alchemists use this ingredient to obtain night vision.
				<h3>Melon Liquor</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Melon Slice</b></div><p/>
				Once it was a synthetic nutritious cocktail which was flavoured with watermelon flavouring.  These cheap, slightly tasteless, but nutritious drinks were once supplied by O.I. to the poor countries of the Earth.<p/>
				Hovewer, over time, the flavouring (which was in a rare turn of events made of real sugar, not sweeteners) has fermented into a liquor, which has slightly reduced the nutrition in the cocktail but increased it's enjoyability.<p/>
				After the Event, scavengers can either find boxes of these liquid rations in the antenna facilities, or summon one with the help of a teleportation beacon.
				<h3>Condensed Chaos Capsule</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Chorus Fruit</b></div><p/>
				Capsules of raw chaos. Upon ingestion, open a quantum rift in Null-Space and teleport user a short distance. This ability suggests that they are a part of Anti-Grav Turrets.
				<hr/>
				<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
				<h3>Supply Beacon</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Melon Seeds</b></div><p/>
				The very first development in quantum engineering, these teleportation beacons served as humanitarian aid for developing and poor countries. Due to their experimental nature, random defects and disruptive background radiation reassembly process of the teleported good takes some time.
				<h3>TV Supply Beacon</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Pumpkin Seeds</b></div><p/>
				The same as an ordinary supply beacon, but instead of food it delivers TV.
				<h3>Antenna Parts</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Bamboo</b></div><p/>
				Antenna Parts were used as the main material for building of antenna facilities.
				<h3>Hydronic Battery</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Bone Meal</b></div><p/>
				This type of batteries contains active chemicals that in their raw form accelerate growth of organics. In the form of energy, they are suitable for charging various machine things, like "In-The-Box" items or self-"replicating" stuff.<p/>
				Batteries can be obtained by robbing bandits (for them this item is very valuable) or by using a special hydronic extractor.
				<h3>Glistering Melon Liquor</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Glistering Melon Slice</b></div><p/>
				Melon liquor is ideal for creating an anti-radiation injection using rare metals dust. However, to use this item, alchemy is required.
				<h3>Croc Co. Power Core</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Ender Pearl</b></div><p/>
				Croc Co. Power Core is the first device created by Dr. Crocopolous within the Croc Co. project.<p/>
				It's connected with V.B.T.W., thereby allowing Experiments to teleport. But for an ordinary person to use it, he must throw the Core to the place where he wants to move. However, this thing harms the health of the thrower.
				<h3>Charged Croc Co. Power Core</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Ender Eye</b></div><p/>
				Creation a Charged version of Croc Co. Power Core requires loading a little helium-3 into an uncharged one. They are needed to search for portal signatures emitted by illegal H.I.V.E.s.<p/>
				To use the Charged Croc Co. Power Core, one need to throw it so that it flies up in the direction of the portal. Either it will spend all the energy of the flight and fall, or it may break irrevocably.<p/>
				Also, these devices are needed to activate an interdimensional portal in the illegal H.I.V.E.
				<h3>Mad Dragon's Breath</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Dragon Breath</b></div><p/>
				This gas is contained in HIS projectiles and can be collected in bottles for further use in alchemy. Potion grenades created on the basis of Breathing will have a lingering sticky effect.
				<h3>Stabilised Chaos Capsules</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Popped Chorus Fruit</b></div><p/>
				Stabilised by heat, these Chaos Capsules no longer open Null-Space quantum rifts and can even be used as building materials.
				<h3>Anti-Grav Turret Fragment</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Shulker Shell</b></div><p/>
				A fragment of casing from an Anti-Grav Turret. It is used in the construction of Quantum Storages.
