				<h2>Resources</h2>
				<h3>Old Piping</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Copper Ore</b></div><p/>
				The H.I.V.E.s, being supposedly able to house many people for extended periods of time, needed plumbing systems. These were made simply from copper pipes imbedded in the walls of some sections of the H.I.V.E. Over time, most of the piping has corroded away making the plumbing systems useless, but still sections of exposed pipes can be found and re-used by the resourcefull explorer.
				<hr/>
				<h2>Utility</h2>
				<h3>Moon Null Anchor (M.N.A.)</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Respawn Anchor</b></div><p/>
				M.N.A. was first created by Creeper for his own Respawn System, so that its users who died on the Moon would have the opportunity to be resurrected on it.<p/>
				The main ingredient of this device is Raw Chaos Container that connects to Null-Paths between Earth and the Moon. However, to communicate with the Respawn System, a lot of directed light energy is required, through which a signal is sent to the System about the location of anchor to which a person has attached himself. Accordingly, for each resurrection the device will spend one Floodlight which can be found all over the Moon.
				<h3>Personal Quantum Storage Interface (P.Q.S.I.)</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Ender Chest</b></div><p/>
				These repositories were created as part of the Croc Co. project as a secret and safe place to store stuff.<p/>
				Each such P.Q.S.I. is connected to a general network of special Null-paths operating as subspace quantum pockets for each user. This means that if a person puts an item in one such storage and opens another, then this item will appear there, as if he put it here.
				<h3>Quantum Storage</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Shulker Box</b></div><p/>
				A box that is built from parts of Anti-Grav Turrets and and a simple crate. it seems to retain their Null-Space quantum features, as it can store a crate's worth of items in a "drawer space" and return them upon opening of the box. mobile.
				<hr/>
				<h2>Building</h2>
				<h3>Box of Supplies</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Melon</b></div><p/>
				These boxes contain melon liquor, a fermented synthetic nutritious cocktail with watermelon flavor that was once supplied to poor countries. The builders of antenna facilities also drink it, so crates can occasionally be found in these places.<p/>
				In the boxes, in addition to supply, there are corresponding teleportation beacons.In the boxes, in addition to supply, there are corresponding teleportation beacons.
				<h3>TV Parts Crate</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Pumpkin</b></div><p/>
				They can occasionally be found in ordinary wastes. Each such box contains a TV that can be used to create robots, and teleportation beacons.
				<h3>Null Reinforced Fabric</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Bedrock</b></div><p/>
				Null Reinforced Fabric was first created by Dr. Crocopolous, thanks to whom the discovery of Null-Space was made.<p/>
				According to the idea, this substance, like M.R.G., should absorb matter and spread outward. Additionally, it is programmed to propagate only perpendicular to the gravity vector. Without the necessary manipulations of quantum engineering, this material is indestructible for any means.<p/>
				On Earth, Null Reinforced Fabric was a limiter for the spread of H.I.V.E. auto-construction. In the Belly O.I. tried to prevent the Event with this material. Well, unsuccessfully, and that's putting it mildly, but due to the fact that this substance conducts the energy of "raw chaos" well, all Moon portals lead there. 
				<h3>Raw Chaos Container</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Crying Obsidian</b></div><p/>
				Raw Chaos Container is Hazardous Waste Container infused with energy from the Abyss of Damnation. It can be found in the destroyed portals between the Moon and Earth, scattered across the Wastes, in Ocean and H.I.V.E.s.<p/>
				Apparently, during the destruction of these portals and the subsequent time of abandonment, some of the Hazardous Waste Containers were filled with raw chaos permeating V.B.T.W. and of which the surface tension of the portal consists.<p/>
				The surviving scientists of the Moon keep these artifacts, hoping someday to return home to Earth.
				<h3>Madness Material</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>End Stone</b></div><p/>
				Some kind of protomaterial generated by the creation power of Abyss. Sometimes you can notice something strange in this substance... Something mad. Was Dr. Crocopolous really that insane?
