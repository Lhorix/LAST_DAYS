				<h2>Earth</h2>
				<h3>The Wastes</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Plains / Forest / Mountains</b></div><p/>
				The wastes are what makes up most of the world; bleak, barren zones inhabitated by only few mutated animals and hardy shrubs, but roamed by hordes of Orbital Industries robots, gangs of Bandits and packs of Lost.<p/>
				Almost all traces of human civilization are gone, only the abandoned H.I.V.E. and scrap shack villages remain, silent reminders of the failure of the once great human society.<p/>
				The H.I.V.E. were constructed by O.I. before the war as subterran networks, linking several cocoon bunkers together into a superstructure.<p/>
				They can be found nearly everywhere and still contain valuable resources and machinery like batteries or gears, for those who dare to explore them.<p/>
				The scrap shack settlements were created by those unlucky human scavengers who would eventually become the Lost. Denied access to the H.I.V.E., they would created makeshift huts on stilts above the ground as protective meassure. However the elevated position couldn’t protect them against the radiation which slowly turned the unlucky survivors into barley human beings, driven only by their instincts.
				<h3>Scrap Shack City</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Dark Forest</b></div><p/>
				These areas were used by the Lost to make huge cities of Scrap Shacks using an upgraded version of the Scrap in the box. But scrap shacks don't really protect people from radiation now, do they? Not only that, huge metallic mushrooms also grow due to the large amount of metal found in the soil.
				<h3>Snow</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Tundra / Taiga</b></div><p/>
				The only regions left mostly unaltered in wake of the Event, the atomic holocaust and the nuclear winter were those uninviting areas that were extremly cold to begin with e.g. high mountains and tundras.<p/>
				When the nuclear fallout fell down in form of radiating snow flakes it wouldn't penetrate the thick layers of snow, ice and frozen ground, leaving the groundwater and plant seeds, burried underneath the permafrost, unpoisoned.<p/>
				After the climate had stabilzed itself somewhat and nature returned to its usual cycle of snowmelt and snowfall, the fallout had already lost most of its hazard potential and the flora, foremost spruce trees, recovered.<p/>
				The fauna wasn't so lucky however. Most animals suffered severe mutations or died by radiation, malnourishment or cold.<p/>
				Only the wolf-dog hybrids managed to adapt in large packs, hunting down the last living creatures in the harsh wilderness.
				<h3>Ice Spikes</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Ice Spikes</b></div><p/>
				<div class="wip">Under construction!</div>
				<h3>Spruce Forests</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Mega Taiga</b></div><p/>
				When the event happened, it started huge forest fires that seem to go on forever. One might assume that this left the area uninhabitable. Instead, the fire made the ground more fertile,not only allowing trees to grow in abundance, but also allowing to grow extremely tall!
				<h3>Desert</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Desert</b></div><p/>
				The Event and the following environmental catastrophes caused lots of already arid areas to dry out completely.<p/>
				Orbital Industries used these areas as disposal zones for their clean-up operation after the Event, storing the sometimes radioactive debris of destroyed cities either deep underground or in barrels throughout the deserts.<p/>
				The irradiated moon dust that fell from the skies in large quantities was dropped on dumps, increasing the uninhabitable desert character of those areas even more.<p/>
				All that remains from this enormous effort are the drilled shafts, sometimes burried in the sand, sometimes flooded and the piles of green barrels scattered around, humming quietly with residual radiation.
				<h3>Wastelands</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Badlands</b></div><p/>
				These areas used to be giant cities with buildings everywhere. But after the Event, the buildings were destroyed and various furniture were scattered. The result is large mountains of junk and debris.
				<h3>Swamp</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Swamp</b></div><p/>
				Lots of areas hit by freak thunderstorms or tsunamis during the Event and the war never recovered. The terrain was eroded by the forces of nature and he deluges of water carrying nuclear fallout were unable to drain off fast enough before the fine mud clogged the ground. Vast expanses of flat, radioactive, stagnant water were the result, void of all life.<p/>
				Years afterwards when the water masses started to receed pioneer species like fungi and vines had returned to the small islands wihin the brackish morass but still tons of fish would die, victims to radiation trapped in the water.
				<h3>Ocean</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Ocean</b></div><p/>
				<div class="wip">Under construction!</div>
				<h3>Solar Energy Collection Fields (S.E.C.F.)</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Sunflower Plains</b></div><p/>
				When fission and fusion materials became scarce, O.I. set out to find alternative. One of the few alternative energies were solar energy. O.I. set up S.E.C. (Solar Energy Collector) at certain areas to collect this type of energy. Alas, this type of energy has been proven to be ineffective as the energy collected wasn't enough to power an entire nation. The project was abandoned soon after in favor of the large antenna facilities.
				<h3>Antenna Facility</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Jungle</b></div><p/>
				Before Orbital Industries' moon landing in 8 B.E., fission and fussion materials on Earth were starting to dwindle.<p/>
				In an effort to keep their own growing industries supplied with cheap electricity, O.I. set out to find alternative energies.<p/>
				They came to the only logical conclusion: Giant lightning absorbing tesla towers! Humongous Facilities covering whole tracts of land, featuring giant copper coils tipped with lightning rods were erected to attract, harvest, store and process lightnings. Each lightning strike would generate whopping 1.21 GW equaling the total energy output of a small plutonium fission rod, while the frequency of giant thunderstorms near the "Antennas" (as this was their official designation) was abnormally high.<p/>
				The ozone created by the lightnings would also be collected by small, expanding canisters attached to the rods and processed into N<sub>2</sub>O which in turn could be used in the creation of medicines and stimulants.<p/>
				The Antennas featured a to date revolutionary system for their construction. A group of A.I.T.B.s (Antenna in the box) would be deployed in an open space. Either through natural sources like light and lightings, or (as it was more often the case) through artificial electricity input those engineering marvels would collect energy.<p/>
				When the critical energy level was met, they would spontaneously convert the stored electricity into matter and "grow" within a few seconds. If a group of AITBs was put close together they would bond and generate a much bigger antenna. (The "In the box" system would be used after the Event by the Lost for the quick construction of their shacks, before they became the braindead monstrosities that they are today)<p/>
				Of course the discovery of huge Helium-3 deposits on the Moon rendered the expensive power plants obsolete, a fact that Mr. History was aware of and therefore "forgot" to mention until he had netted contracts for the construction of thousands of Antennas around the world.<p/>
				Once again he got away with it, by offering to upgrade the Antennas into weather control devices, radar scramblers, tesla anti-air and anti-ground weapons or all of those options combined... against a fee of course.<p/>
				After the Event, the upgraded antennas were used to counteract the drastic climate changes, but to no avail. During the war they were used as weapons, with devastating effects, but unable to stop the deployment of nuclear weaponary.<p/>
				After the period of bloodshed the former power plants began to decay, turning into giant expanses of rubble, home to a lot of stray cats leading their pitiful lifes underneath the still intact antennas.
				<h3>Antenna Parts Facility</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Bamboo Jungle</b></div><p/>
				<div class="wip">Under construction!</div>
				<h3>Military Radio Antenna Fields (M.R.A.F.)</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Savanna</b></div><p/>
				In the late stages of the war, desperate military authorities began an ambitious project with the goal of creating a possible haven for soldiers and military forces. Engineers reverse-engineered the lightning conducting antennas of OI's tesla towers more or less successfully. The aim of using antennas was to facilitate long-range communication between divisions by transmitting messages using the stilt. Sadly, these poorly conceived structures were almost as transparent to radiation as their scrap-shack predecessors, slowly killing off the remaining military forces and plunging H.I.V.E.-dwelling postwar survivors into a state of total anarchy.
				<h3>Mushroom</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Mushroom Fields</b></div><p/>
				Only months before the Event, Orbital Industries started to cover some isolated islands with an experimental plating against nuclear radiation called Funga-plast.<p/>
				This carefulness was due to the the remarkable and a slightly uncontrollable properties of the new shielding material: it was self-reparing and replicating.<p/>
				Somewhat similar to fungal mycelium, it would absorb minerals and moisture from the ground and form a thick, ground covering, crystalline structure resembling metal sheets. While dense enough to be stepped on and able to absorb incoming radiation of various magnitudes, the Funga-plast was no where near as durable as any actual metal.<p/>
				O.I.'s foresight to limit their initial deployment of Funga-plast payed off, as side effects became known: other spore based life forms, mostly mushrooms and fungi, settled within the nutrient rich confines of the Funga-plast, turning the radiation shield into a breeding ground. The massive amount of spores that lingerd in the air clogged the respiratory systems of any living being, and the cooling units of all robots, in the area.<p/>
				Another side effect was that the Funga-plast would fuse with the fruiting bodies of various fungi, using them as a medium to grow into absurd pseudo-metallic platforms resembling the former mushrooms.<p/>
				For those reasons O.I. deemed the radiation shield project a failure and abandoned the almost lifeless islands.<p/>
				Unbeknownst to them, a strand of stonebacks would manage to withstand the constant spore exposure, albeit even more mutated and as a living host to mold and mushrooms.
				<hr/>
				<h2>H.I.V.E.</h2>
				<h3>H.I.V.E. Sanctuary Remains</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Lush Caves</b></div><p/>
				Sanctuaries were once the hope of many people for a safe and peaceful life in H.I.V.E.s. Now it's in the past, only the ruins tell us that this place was once inhabited.<p/>
				After the Event, the Lost started building villages out of Scrap Shacks. However, they didn't have radiation resistance, which is why many of them began to become infected, becoming half-corpses. However, former O.I. quantum engineers have created an makeshift likeness of M.R.G., which is able to create a safe haven right in H.I.V.E. Constructions built on the basis of this substance were called Sanctuaries.<p/>
				Sanctuary Constructing Goo (S.C.G.), biochemical in nature, was distributed through H.I.V.E. manually (many hydronic batteries were used for this, but it was worth it) The following appeared "out of nowhere": "In-The-Box" shacks made specifically for Sanctuary, water purifiers and luminescent nutritious bacterial proteins. It would seem that life is getting better, but it wasn't there...<p/>
				Radiation, the influx of zombified Lost, bandits, broken Hall Monitors and similar misfortunes determined the fate of these places.
				<h3>H.I.V.E. Piping Systems</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Dripstone Caves</b></div><p/>
				There is nothing complicated in this: just a pipe system, which, like all O.I. developments in Null-Engineering, is able to "self-replicate". There's nothing more to say, yeah. 
				<h3>S.CH.O.N. Domain</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Deep Dark</b></div><p/>
				If you, walking through the dark corners of the hive, have found some kind of red infection, then avoid these places for your own safety!<p/>
				However, legends speak of abandoned ancient cities full of treasures. If you dare to go there, then remember one simple thing: do not make a noise, otherwise you risk becoming a delicacy for the monsters there.
				<hr/>
				<h2>The Moon</h2>
				<h3>Moon Wastes</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Nether Wastes</b></div><p/>
				If we compare all the other places in the Belly, then these wastes are the safest of all. At least until you provoke one of those mutated moon scientists.
				<h3>Large Waste Dump</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Basalt Deltas</b></div><p/>
				No one wants to end up in a giant radioactive dump where most of the Moon trash is stored. This is pure poison, so for your safety, don't go there!<p/>
				This damn dump is constantly teeming with broken P.W.C., which strive to "eat" short-sighted travelers. Don't get caught! 
				<h3>Irradiated Moondust Valley</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Soul Sand Valley</b></div><p/>
				This lifeless desert is the second (after the Great Dump) in radiation pollution. Unattended hydronic batteries, once used by Moon scientists, can be found throughout the valleys.<p/>
				This place was chosen by bandits, for whom hydronic batteries are the main value. Don't ask why the hell they got here, or you'll get a firearm projectile in the heart.
				<h3>Medicinal Fungaplast Settlement</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Crimson Forest</b></div><p/>
				On Earth, O.I. scientists once invented a fungaplast, which was tested on isolated islands. But because of its side effects, the project became abandoned. Nevertheless, this material was used on the Moon, which became the basis of future medicinal fungaplast facilities (now known as Fungal Gardens).<p/>
				All this was started for the sake of special medicinal mushroom spores that neutralize the radiation effects of the Belly. Fortunately, this time the project turned out to be more or less successful.<p/>
				After the Event, these places was chosen by stonerats for life, and their spores spread all over the Moon, which is why not all scientists and none of the stonerats were exposed to a dangerous dose of radiation.
				<h3>Warped Fungaplast Settlement</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Warped Forest</b></div><p/>
				An alternate version of the medical fungaplast settlements, also known as the Ghost Garden.<p/>
				Mycelium spores emitted by fungal structures are designed to affect the Null-Space to open two-way portals between Earth and the Belly.<p/>
				During the Event, because of HIS actions, these fungal spores began to malfunction and open portals not just to Null-Space, but to the Realm of Madness itself. Soon the place was teeming with Experiments. 
				<hr/>
				<h2>Realm of Madness</h2>
				<h3>R.o.M. Core</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>End Central Island</b></div><p/>
				R.o.M. Core is the center of this whole damn place. Remote from all other islands for a kilometer in radius, this one is now a prison for a Mad Dragon. All interdimensional portals in illegal H.I.V.E.s lead there, to a special platform made of Hazardous Waste Containers.<p/>
				Ten pillars made of the same material with Mad Crystals on top were created for one purpose: to support HIS life.<p/>
				At the very center of this island is the exit portal created from indestructible Null Reinforced Fabric. To open the portal, one must first kill HIM, and nothing else.<p/>
				Given that HE is not really dead, he can be "resurrected". Four Madness Crystals on the sides of exit portal will do their job: the columns will be restored, HE will be revived, but the portal will be closed. HE will not be able to get out, this is HIS punishment from fate... or did someone lock HIM up that way?
				<h3>R.o.M. Expanse</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>End Highlands / End Midlands / End Barrens / Small End Islands</b></div><p/>
				All these islands are far from R.o.M. Core. Most of the Experiments live there, among the sprawling CH.R.U.-5 which absorb the very fabric of this realm.<p/>
				Sometimes travelers can find a R.o.M. Gateway linking Core and Expanse. But the most important thing in this world is R.o.M. Research Labs that store valuable resources for the scavenger.
