				"Last Days" other information and stuff:<p/>
				<hr/>
				<h2>Mechanics</h2>
				<h3>Null-Engineering</h3>
				Null-Engineering is a complex of methods of interaction with Null-Space. Before the discovery of the Abyss, this discipline was called Quantum Engineering.<p/>
				The first full-fledged developments in this field were teleportation supply beacons that delivered foodstuffs to poor countries for a certain price.<p/>
				Both boxes of supplies and, subsequently, TV parts crates appeared from O.I. special storages, from where they were delivered to the designated place according to the coordinates of the beacon.<p/>
				Similar techniques were used to create a full-fledged "In-The-Box" system. The Antenna parts were the first such development that used the primitive reintegration of matter from parts stored in warehouses. Later it became the basis for the construction of Antenna Facilities.<p/>
				The next project was a matter-reintegrating goo (M.R.G.), which served to accelerate the construction of the H.I.V.E.s, because there were too many people who wanted to hide from a potential nuclear war.<p/>
				For this goo, a limiter was needed that did not allow it to spread below a certain height. It was the material that made Dr. Crocopolus a career: Null Reinforced Fabric. That substance itself spread perpendicular to the gravity vector. The fact that it was a resonator of "raw chaos" served as the discovery of Void.<p/>
				Shortly before the Event, the Reintegration Center was built in the Abyss, which absorbed the useless matter of dead creatures (so as not to rot in the ground) and turned it into useful stuff. Which ones depended on the addressee: antenna parts, boxes of supplies, "In-The-Box" system and more. After the Event, this system failed and began to absorb all the deceased creatures, including robots.<p/>
				Today, the slang "quagic" is common among the survivors, which means "quantum magic", or Null-Engineering. Those who use it for their own purposes are called "quages". The attitude towards them is not always friendly, but justified or not – in different ways.
				<h3>Alchemy</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Brewing</b></div><p/>
				There are two disciplines that the ignorant refer to as "magic": Null-Engineering (or Quantum Engineering a.k.a. "quagic") and Alchemy. If the first can still be understood, then the second is the height of barbarism.<p/>
				Alchemy, or Brewing, in the post-war world more resembles medieval alchemical disciplines than modern science, based on trial and error and the occasional use of involuntary test subjects.<p/>
				This is the "science" of making potions, so stock up on cola bottles. The first thing you need is <sup>3</sup>He Distilling Stand to create potions. At second, find some moonshrooms in the Moonlabs. At third, supply your stand with pure <sup>3</sup>He for operation. Draw water from the nearest source (purity doesn't matter) and you are now an alchemist! A beginner, of course... but you have to start somewhere.
				<h3>Respawn System</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Respawn</b></div><p/>
				There are rumors among the survivors about immortal demigods, for whom death is nothing more than a temporary inconvenience. Well, no matter what myths are spread about these people, one thing is clear: immortality is real!<p/>
				It all started with an obsessive fear of death. This was the main dream of Creeper, and for the sake of it he spent days and nights studying the miraculously surviving O.I. records about secret experiments with what was called Null-Space. After dozens of failures, Creeper made the database right in the fabric of the Void Between The Worlds, which is able to store templates of bodies and personalities for resurrection.<p/>
				Having joined the experimental volunteer to this database, he made sure: resurrection, or as he will call it in the future, "respawn", works! Although the mind and body were similar before the "death" of the subject, his equipment, resources and garbage were left aside there. Well, so fate decreed: that's the price for "immortality".<p/>
				The system gives the user the opportunity to personally set their "respawn" point. This trigger is the bed, only this possibility works on the Earth. Outside of it, the bed may explode due to an unresolved malfunction.<p/>
				For a correct respawn on the Moon, Creeper created a Moon Null Anchor. Now users of Respawn System can not be afraid of the Belly. Without an anchor, a dying person will be reborn on Earth.<p/>
				There are two types of connection to this system: legal (through a Creeper or his assistants) or illegal. In the latter case, it may happen that immortality is in fact imaginary, although the system seems to work.
				<h3>Materialized Null-Particles (M.N.P.)</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Experience Orbs</b></div><p/>
				During the Event, due to a malfunction of the Null-Paths used in the O.I. experimental Moon portal, the energy of raw chaos, which makes up the Void Between the Worlds, broke into the real world, crystallizing in the form of Materialized Null-Particles (M.N.P.). These particles settled in all three known worlds and were absorbed into matter itself and, in particular, into organic and robotic beings.<p/>
				A special collector is required to work with these particles. The Masked use old magnetic tapes for this purpose. For scavengers, this collector is integrated directly into a Personal Inventory Manager (P.I.M.).<p/>
				Using these particles, it is possible to "encode" reality. Such methods are most widely used in improving the properties of tools and weapons. It's much easier to hit enemies with weapons "enchanted" to ignite, isn't it?
				<h3>Null-Appearance</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Mobs Spawn</b></div><p/>
				It is very rare to see how living beings of organic and robotic nature disappear without a trace or appear out of nowhere.<p/>
				Alas, the mechanism of this anomaly is not fully understood, but one well-known thing can save a life: your living space must be illuminated! The light prevents the appearance of hostile creatures in your shelter, so yes, the fear of darkness is more than justified these days.<p/>
				Lightning is another strange anomaly. In fact, these are the same lightning bolts, but in addition to electricity, they contain a little M.N.P., which are able to open Null-portals for a moment.<p/>
				Because of the portals, lightning is able to replace some creatures with others of an "opposite nature", whatever that means. Only a few can be subject to this "transformation".<p/>
				The only ones who somehow understand the properties of these anomalies are bandits. They are able to appear out of "nowhere" together with their modified H.O.R.S., foreshadowing a Wild Hunt.
				<h3>"In-The-Box" System</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Saplings / Bamboo</b></div><p/>
				The "In-The-Box" system is a procedure using the reintegration of matter, with the help of which a given object in a special box instantly "grows" to the desired size.<p/>
				Initially, the "Box" accumulates the energy of the sun, and when its amount reaches a critical size, it instantly "grows", taking matter from the Reintegration Center through miniature quantum portals (once from ordinary O.I. storage facilities).<p/>
				This system was once used to build Antenna Facilities. After the Event, the Lost, who have not yet become walking half-corpses, created a Shack-In-The-Box based on these studies.

				<h2>Some recordings</h2>
				<h3>About an illegal H.I.V.E.</h3>
				<div class="record">
					<div class="greener">From: █████████</div><p/>
					<div class="greener">To: ████████████</div><p/>
					<div class="greener">Subject: Disappearance of ███ ██████ and possible connection to Dr ██████████████████</div><p/>
					The theory I introduced in my report 10 hours ago seems to be accurate. Our agent "Creeper" has located the source of the mysterious portal signatures and found evidence of a massive illegal H.I.V.E. close to ██████ between ██████ and █████████ on the coordinates ████████. According to his findings it's financed by Croc.Co. Furthermore "Creeper" has witnessed the incoming of three armored transport trucks with ventilation slots, which hints towards living cargo. The number plates were ██████, ██████ and ██████ and turned out to be registered for a letterbox company in █████████. All this seems to proof that to Dr ██████████████████ is experimenting on humans.<p/>
					The Orbital Industries employee we took in two days ago disclosed that ███ ██████ had initiated a company-internal inquiry against to Dr ██████████████████ because he suspected him off unethical work methods. This led to to Dr ██████████████████'s departure. The entire affair was preceded by a dispute between ███ ██████ and to Dr ██████████████████ because of a denied experimental cyborg procedure to revive the latters wife. The employee went on and reported that during his work under to Dr ██████████████████ he has had access to experiment files that described a being similar to the unidentified assailants that destroyed the Orbital Industries office building in ████████, by mysteriously appearing inside and removing its foundation.<p/>
					The interrogation of to Dr ██████████████████'s cleaning woman was largely inconclusive, except for the fact that to Dr ██████████████████ became reclusive after the death of his wife and developed a strange fixation on penguins.<p/>
					I know our resources are streched thin with the ongoing hostilites after that terrible Event, but I request backup in storming that illegal H.I.V.E. We can't win a possible war with enemies lurking within our own borders, especially if they are setting up portals.<p/>

				<h3>"Creeper"'s diary</h3>
				<div class="record">
					<div class="greener">Ooooone</div><p/>
					The madness of the world forces me to write these lines. Everything is gone and no one is here to share my plight. HIS eyes burn in my mind, I haven't found sleep for days. Is someone coming? One of those monsters?! No they only live down in that Notch-forsaken H.I.V.E.! The lonleyness makes me hear things, I always hear the scuttling of those abominable roaches who almost ate my face! They are coming for me! Both of them. An all I have is a tattered H.I.V.E. shirt and my trousers. They won't get them!<p/>
					<div class="greener">Too</div><p/>
					I ate a lizzard. Notch help me! What have I done?! I'm feeling sick, green bubbles everywhere. I hear HIM whispering in my dreams. At least HE's gone silent while I'm awake. Time to puke!<p/>
					<div class="greener">March 16th 13 AE</div><p/>
					I had a lot of time to think and get my thoughts straight while I spent the last 3 days curled up in some kind of elevated shack, sick with food poisoning. I can't believe I really wrote the last 2 entries, but it's not suprising that I went mad after all I've been through. I still find myself giggling to myself and I have an uneasy sleep, I prefer to stay awake.<p/>
					I forgot my name but according to a message left to me, I was an agent called "Creeper". I don't recall much of my last mission but I know that it nearly drove me insane.<p/>
					I faced pure madness.<p/>
					I ran around a place out of this world, on dead bodies strapped in machines, tall horrific experiments mercilessly staring at me, vanishing into thin air only to reappear behind me.<p/>
					And HE was there.<p/>
					HIS name is unpronouncable, HIS white eyes staring into my very soul and HIS laughter haunting my dreams. I'm sorry, I let it get to me again. The "HE" I wrote about is a terrifying mixture of man, beast and machine that I don't even want to think about. It chased me around that nightmare for aeons.<p/>
					Aeon, what a strange word. I'm getting side tracked again. I don't know how, but I woke up next to what I know was the entrance back to this realm of madness. Giant roaches had eaten almost all of my clothes and were about to take a bit out of me! I ran away, through the confusing installation which I remember to be an illegal H.I.V.E. I replaced my ragged clothes with what clothes I could find. Finally I found the exit, and next to it a table with a note for me. Some superior whom I don't remember explained to me that a war was happening and that they couldn't search for me anymore. There was a clock which broke down shortly thereafter which told me the year.<p/>
					I invented my own time system based on "The Event" when those crazed bunglers at O.I. blew up the Moon. The Moon … HE was responsible for that, I now know that. HE told me…<p/>
					I have to concentrate. Like I wrote: I have a new time system and it's the 16th of March 13 years after the Event. I don't know how so much time could have passed after I entered that portal or whatever that demonic device was. I've ran from the H.I.V.E. into the bleak wastes. There definetly had been a nuclear war.<p/>
					My P.I.M. (Personal Inventory Manager), which is the last part of my equipment, informs me that my state of health is pretty good considering the circumstances. No radiation, no traces of remaining poison, no major wounds and after I ate that giant rat (or pig, what know I what it looked like before it mutated). I also feel sated and strong. Apart from that my situation is looking grim.<p/>
					I don't remeber where I am or who I am. Perhaps I can regain my identity by returning to that H.I.V.E… Haha just kidding, I'm not that crazy. Or am I? Whatever, I need to find food, tools and shelter first, before I develop any suicidal plans. And I need to find more paper, I'm runni-

				<h3>"In-The-Box" System explanation</h3>
				<div class="record">
					Have you ever wondered how the shack-in-a-box grew so quickly in an instant? The packaging states it collects power from the  sun and turns it into matter. Well, that is partially correct. The power harvested from the sun feeds minature "null portals", which, when reaching critical power levels, draw in a large amount of matter, "instantly" turning into a shack, or an antenna, or whatever else was programmed.<p/>
