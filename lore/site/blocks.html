				"Last Days" blocks list:<p/>
				<hr/>
				<h2>Resources</h2>
				<h3>Old Piping</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Copper Ore</b></div><p/>
				The H.I.V.E.s, being supposedly able to house many people for extended periods of time, needed plumbing systems. These were made simply from copper pipes imbedded in the walls of some sections of the H.I.V.E. Over time, most of the piping has corroded away making the plumbing systems useless, but still sections of exposed pipes can be found and re-used by the resourcefull explorer.
				<h3>Safe</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Golden Ore</b></div><p/>
				Radiation protection was a top priority for H.I.V.E.s. One of the most expensive methods was the use of anti-radiation rare metals in treatment. They are stored in sealed safes, which are now valuable prey for scavengers descending deeper into abandoned cocoons.
				<h3>Rare Metals Container</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Nether Golden Ore</b></div><p/>
				Rare metals, due to their anti-radiation healing properties, were most useful in the Belly. Now they're very much appreciated by the not yet fully mutated Moon scientists, so much so that they're ready to tear anyone to shreds who steals their "property".
				<h3>Hydrazine Emergency Backup Generator</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Emerald Ore</b></div><p/>
				It's one of the emergency energy sources in H.I.V.E. This device create electricity by burning hydrazine. Should the highly toxic gas escape the apparatus, green warning lamps start to flash. The remnants of hydrazine can still be pulled out of the generator and used for their own needs.
				<h3>Strange Moon Technology Container</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Ancient Debris</b></div><p/>
				These containers are rarely found inside the Belly. It looks like they were deliberately hidden in the rock. Amazingly, it is absolutely resistant to the destructive power of radioactive waste. Looks like it contains something very valuable...
				<hr/>
				<h2>Utility</h2>
				<h3>M.N.P. Infuser</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Enchanting Table</b></div><p/>
				This device is capable of manipulating M.N.P. and filling tools with them. Paper is an ideal keeper of the M.N.P.-based code, so books are a good option for an infuser.<p/>
				The more memory is provided to this device, the better it will "enchant" things, so it is customary to arrange book storages around the infuser as additional memory for work.<p/>
				This coding method has one weakness: due to the chaotic nature of M.N.P., it is impossible to say exactly what properties a particular tool will acquire. Accordingly, first the M.N.P.-code is written into books, and later they are used for "enchanting".<p/>
				For use, the device requires energy from Plutonium Containers. The more, the more effective the "enchantment".
				<h3>Moon Null Anchor (M.N.A.)</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Respawn Anchor</b></div><p/>
				M.N.A. was first created by Creeper for his own Respawn System, so that its users who died on the Moon would have the opportunity to be resurrected on it.<p/>
				The main ingredient of this device is Raw Chaos Container that connects to Null-Paths between Earth and the Moon. However, to communicate with the Respawn System, a lot of directed light energy is required, through which a signal is sent to the System about the location of anchor to which a person has attached himself. Accordingly, for each resurrection the device will spend one Floodlight which can be found all over the Moon.
				<h3>Personal Quantum Storage Interface (P.Q.S.I.)</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Ender Chest</b></div><p/>
				These repositories were created as part of the Croc Co. project as a secret and safe place to store stuff.<p/>
				Each such P.Q.S.I. is connected to a general network of special Null-paths operating as subspace quantum pockets for each user. This means that if a person puts an item in one such storage and opens another, then this item will appear there, as if he put it here.
				<h3>Quantum Storage</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Shulker Box</b></div><p/>
				A box that is built from parts of Anti-Grav Turrets and and a simple crate. it seems to retain their Null-Space quantum features, as it can store a crate's worth of items in a "drawer space" and return them upon opening of the box. mobile.
				<hr/>
				<h2>Building</h2>
				<h3>Box of Supplies</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Melon</b></div><p/>
				These boxes contain melon liquor, a fermented synthetic nutritious cocktail with watermelon flavor that was once supplied to poor countries. The builders of antenna facilities also drink it, so crates can occasionally be found in these places.<p/>
				In the boxes, in addition to supply, there are corresponding teleportation beacons.
				<h3>TV Parts Crate</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Pumpkin</b></div><p/>
				They can occasionally be found in ordinary wastes. Each such box contains a TV that can be used to create robots, and teleportation beacons.
				<h3>Null Reinforced Fabric</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Bedrock</b></div><p/>
				Null Reinforced Fabric was first created by Dr. Crocopolous, thanks to whom the discovery of Null-Space was made.<p/>
				According to the idea, this substance, like M.R.G., should absorb matter and spread outward. Additionally, it is programmed to propagate only perpendicular to the gravity vector. Without the necessary manipulations of quantum engineering, this material is indestructible for any means.<p/>
				On Earth, Null Reinforced Fabric was a limiter for the spread of H.I.V.E. auto-construction. In the Belly O.I. tried to prevent the Event with this material. Well, unsuccessfully, and that's putting it mildly, but due to the fact that this substance conducts the energy of "raw chaos" well, all Moon portals lead there. 
				<h3>Raw Chaos Container</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Crying Obsidian</b></div><p/>
				Raw Chaos Container is Hazardous Waste Container infused with energy from the Abyss of Damnation. It can be found in the destroyed portals between the Moon and Earth, scattered across the Wastes, in Ocean and H.I.V.E.s.<p/>
				Apparently, during the destruction of these portals and the subsequent time of abandonment, some of the Hazardous Waste Containers were filled with raw chaos permeating V.B.T.W. and of which the surface tension of the portal consists.<p/>
				The surviving scientists of the Moon keep these artifacts, hoping someday to return home to Earth.
				<h3>Security Chaos-Organic Network (S.CH.O.N.)</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Sculk</b></div><p/>
				This controlled substance was created by chief Null-Engineers of Post-Event H.I.V.E. Haven Cities to protect people from external enemies. It has a dual nature: it is an organic, located in the material universe, held together by a system of Null-paths and mini-pockets of reality, called the "soul".  At the moment, the overall "soul" of the entire network has evolved into an animal consciousness that strives for food and reproduction.
				<h3>S.CH.O.N. Catalyst</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Sculk Catalyst</b></div><p/>
				Once upon a time, these devices ensured the safety of H.I.V.E. Haven Cities, creating a controlled S.CH.O.N. goo. Now it is a hotbed of insane animal consciousness. Too many creatures it has swallowed up, and still hasn't had enough.
				<h3>S.CH.O.N. Sensor</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Sculk Sensor</b></div><p/>
				S.CH.O.N. Sensor provides the connection of consciousness with the external material world. To avoid being spotted, sneak or walk on soundproof blocks. Otherwise, if there is a S.CH.O.N. Shreaker next to you, then you risk summoning a monster.<p/>
				Separated from S.CH.O.N., this sensor can be used in various mechanisms, especially for primitive wireless communication.
				<h3>S.CH.O.N. Shrieker</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Sculk Shrieker</b></div><p/>
				These organic formations have been called Shriekers because of their sounds when activated. They can only be disturbed if something touches them, or if they're awakened by a nearby S.CH.O.N. Sensor. You may be lucky if S.CH.O.N. takes you for a rustle, but if you keep being reckless, it will summon the S.CH.O.N. Beast to hunt you.
				<h3>Madness Material</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>End Stone</b></div><p/>
				Some kind of protomaterial generated by the creation power of Abyss. Sometimes you can notice something strange in this substance... Something mad. Was Dr. Crocopolous really that insane?
