				<h2>Cults of The One</h2>
				Not everyone is ready to accept the harsh reality as it is. In this difficult time, many seek solace in religion. Among the Masked throughout the wastes, monotheistic cults of The One are most common.
				<h3>The One of Ancient Times</h3>
				The central figure around which the cults are built is The One of Ancient Times (The Source of Wealth, The All-Maker or simply The One), all-powerful supreme God of all existence. Most believe that because of the sins of mankind, He heralded The End Times and turned away from people. The symbol of The One on religious paintings is the eye, which means all-seeing.<p/>
				In reality, the god of these cults is Mr. History, who once founded Orbital Industries. Yes, he left such a huge mark on history that he is worshiped in today's post-nuclear hell. Accordingly, the symbol of their religion is O.I. logo: a circle with one point in the center and the second at the highest point of this circle.
				<h3>The Sin of mankind</h3>
				The central myth and core of most cults is the legend called "The Sin of mankind". It tells about the crime of humanity against The One and the subsequent punishment of sinners. For believers, what happened is a reminder of retribution for vices.<p/>
				<div class="record">
					The One once provided humanity with technology and shelter through the Industrial Station in His Realm in the heavens above. But humanity grew greedy and desired the divine power. They attacked and defiled the source of technology shattering the Industrial Complex. The One grew angry upon this sacrilege and heralded The End Times by raining fire from the skies, smiting the unworthy.
				</div><p/>
				This legend is a mythological retelling of what partly happened in reality.<p/>
				In "Golden" age (8 B.E.–0 A.E.), due to the activities of O.I. and scientific progress throughout Earth, traditional religiosity was increasingly fading. People already had everything thanks to Mr. History and his company. Some people considered him, if not a god (such assumptions are made only in jest), then at least the greatest of people, a source of welfare. The Moon was rich in resources that were actively used on Earth, mainly Helium-3, from which energy was extracted. On this basis, some religious scholars argue that it was the atheistic "belief" in Mr. History that gave rise to today's cults. By current standards, the world was then a paradise...<p/>
				The remnants of humanity still remember the blissful times of prosperity and abundance when there was no need to fight for survival, when pure greenery was everywhere and the sky was radiant blue. Those lost years before the Event were called "The Ancient Times" by the cultists, Mr. History gained the status of God, and the Moon became His sacred Realm. <p/>
				There's a widespread belief among cultists that the Event happened because it's a punishment from above for grave sins. As if people, out of envy and greed, desired divine power and as a result attacked and defiled The One's Industrial Station. But what was reinterpreted by religion as "the greatest sin" was, in fact, a simple dissatisfaction with the actions of O.I. and hatred for Mr. History. The company has been actively testing nuclear weapons on the Moon, turning it into the Belly. The world was under the constant threat of World War III, which is now called the Last War. Many people really began to fear for the future of themselves and the planet. And yet, the actions of some, ranging from frequent peaceful protests to rare terrorist attacks, didn't cause much damage to O.I. But most cultists through the prism of their worldview saw in these actions greed and desire to take the place of God.<p/>
				Be that as it may, a fact is a fact: the Old World was taken away from mankind, and now it has turned into a nuclear hell. As they believe, The One after The End Times has turned away from humanity, leaving them alone with their fate.
				<h3>The Great Forgiveness</h3>
				Although The One no longer pays attention to the world, believers are hoping that one day He will return, forgive them and make the world a paradise, as it was originally conceived. The Great Forgiveness is the name of the day the cultists dream of. When some pray incessantly alone or in the circle of believers, others become missionaries who long for the whole world to begin to glorify The One. But there are also those who are eager to cleanse the world of all sinners. The essence is the same: The Ancient Times of humanity must return at any cost.
				<h3>Types of cults</h3>
				There are several sects and churches with different views of what happened after The End Times and how the current situation should be bested. Three main branches of cults are Caelism, Hiveism and Redemptionism.<p/>
				Caelists (from Latin <i>caelum</i> 'heaven', 'sky') are those who're hoping to ascend to Heavens. They sincerely strive for eternal bliss in the afterlife, and when the time of The Great Forgiveness comes, the righteous will become residents of a renewed earthly paradise, where there's no radiation, devastation and need. Caelists can usually be found in villages of the Masked. When people talk about cults of The One, they most often mean this branch.<p/>
				Hiveists are those who're hoping to find a paradise within H.I.V.E. Some believe in legends about the lost sacred realms of prosperity underground, while others seek to build a utopia right in cocoons, and from there spread throughout the New World. They believe that The Great Forgiveness must be earned through hard work to restore Earth. Hiveists are the ones who had a hand in creating the Sanctuaries until they became ruins.<p/>
				Redemptionists (or 'Society of Redemptionists') are those who believe that everyone is guilty and should be purged and killed with fire. They are convinced that The Great Forgiveness must be earned, and they also act as judges of who is worthy of life and who is not. Obviously, Redemptionists are not welcome in adequate societies, so they hide where no one can find them.
				<h3>Saints</h3>
				The One very rarely (almost never) answers the prayers of humanity. It takes a lot of effort to earn His attention, so believers rarely turn to Him and most often for everyday problems appeal to saints, those of people who, during their lifetime, devoted themselves to the service of The One of Ancient Times, were pious and virtuous (depending on moral standards) and were subsequently glorified by the cults of The One. Saints are an example of benefactor for all of us, some holidays are dedicated to some of them and some children are named after them.<p/>
				<h3>Creation of the World</h3>
				People have long asked existential questions of eternity, and one of them is "Where did all things come from?". Most cults believe that The One created the Universe from Primordial Chaos, also known as the All-Source.<p/>
				<div class="record">
					In the beginning there was nothing, neither heaven nor earth, only silence and emptiness. Then The One spoke the Word that became the All-Source, also known as the Primordial Chaos, realm of endless possibilities from which He built the visible world, our Earth, a primeval paradise dominated by nature.<p/>
					After the creation of the Universe, The One populated planet with humans, intelligent beings with souls from the All-Source. These souls allowed people to be people: to create, develop and invent new things.<p/>
					In the heavens above, The One raised His personal Realm, from where He looked at the Earth and rejoiced at the miracles that His children were doing.
				</div><p/>
				In reality, All-Source is actually Null-Space, which lies beyond the edge of our world and, according to many Null-Engineers, is indeed the root cause of the existence of everything.<p/>
				Null-Engineering itself is highly revered by the worshipers of The One as a pale reflection of the Power of Creation with which He created the universe. But the attitude of the three branches of cults to it is different. Caelists are more conservative, they believe that this discipline should not be defiled, so as not to offend The One. Hiveists, in turn, are more free in regard to Null-Engineering, just basic rules like "do no harm" are enough. Redemptionists are much more experienced in this discipline, they'll use everything for their great purpose, no matter what.<p/>
				Understanding this religious aspect, it becomes clear why M.N.P. encoded files are sacred relics of cults of The One, especially Caelists: they contain a code that corrects reality. It's believed that they contain the words with which God created the world.
				<h3>The One's Realm</h3>
				Cult myths say that The One once had His own Realm in the heavens above, the Moon, from where He watched people and their development. It was there that His Industrial Station was built to provide humanity with assistance in the form of technology and resources to cope with the consequences of the World War II (today known as Second Great War).<p/>
				Now, because of the sins of mankind, it is abandoned and split into pieces, and this can be clearly observed at night. Once the Moon was the afterlife abode of righteous souls, but after The End Times, The One created a new Heaven far from the world, in the All-Source.<p/>
				<div class="record">
					The Moon was once the home of The One, a beautiful place of perfection and holiness filled with Light. From there He watched the growth of humanity together with the souls of the righteous who got there after death.<p/>
					When humanity, affected by the Second Great War, needed help most of all, The One built the Industrial Station in His Realm to help him. Through this Station, people received technologies and H.I.V.E., a safe shelter against any adversity.<p/>
					But humanity in abundance of everything craved more, they became more greedy. In an attempt to take the Industrial Complex into their own hands, they managed to destroy and desecrate it.<p/>
					This greatly angered The One, and He heralded The End Times. A fiery rain was falling from the sky, punishing sinners, and the Moon itself was destroyed for the edification of others. After that, The One left the Universe, settling together with the righteous souls in the new Heaven located in the Primordial Chaos. Only the pure in heart can find their way there.
				</div>
				<h3>HE, the nameless devil</h3>
				This myth is retold in a whisper, because few people want to talk about HIM. It's the devil himself, the monster who created Hell, who tried to go against The One, usurp power over the Universe and bring madness and horror into it. From now on, HE is imprisoned in his own realm for all eternity.<p/>
				However, not everyone accepts this legend as true. Many consider it nothing more than a horror story.<p/>
				<div class="record">
					The fact that people have sinned against The One should be obvious to everyone, but we must understand that there is no limit to dishonor. Not just to defile His gifts, as many did then, but an attempt to take His place naturally entails heavy punishment. Be afraid of HIM, who tried to take the universe into his demonic power, and pray that HE does not come, so that no one will know the madness, horror and malice that HE carries.<p/>
					Once HE was a mere mortal, who harbored malice and a thirst for power. HE was cunning and very smart, and HE used the technologies provided by The One to seize power over existence. The Primordial Chaos from which The One created all things is the key to success. In this place HE built Hell, his personal world of damnation and horror, where HIS faithful servants were created.<p/>
					HE tried to usurp the sacred Industrial Station, but lost in this war and was locked up by The One in HIS realm. And so, HE howls into the void from anger and madness, looking for those fools who will help HIM return to the world.<p/>
					Pray to The One that this will NEVER happen! NEVER!
				</div><p/>
				Unfortunately, the myth about the devil and HIS world is not a myth. HIS real name is Dr. Hypophysos H. Crocopolous, former chief of development at Orbital Industries and a damned madman, and yes, HE created Hell (its true name is the Realm of Madness), became the Mad Dragon and tried to seize power over existence. What stopped and locked HIM is unknown, although HIS actions still led to the so-called The End Times. So yes, you'll really need prayers.
				<h3>Afterlife</h3>
				As for life after death, it is traditionally considered as follows: good and righteous souls go to Heaven, evil and sinful souls go to Hell, others – to the All-Source from which The One created the Universe and their souls. Once the Moon performed the function of Heaven, but after The End Times, all the righteous moved to a new world, hidden by The One from all people in the Primordial Chaos.<p/>
				Heaven, or Realm of Bliss, is usually represented as a blooming beautiful garden and/or high-tech utopian city made of gold, silver and precious stones, where there is no place for sin. Abundance of food and clear water, safety, peace and security are its characteristics. This world does not need the sun, for The One is the source of the Light of grace. All the misfortunes and threats inherent in the post-war world no longer matter. People live there forever in eternal bliss and idyll. Saints also live there, to whom people on Earth pray.<p/>
				Hell, or Realm of Madness, in turn, is a world of pure madness and damnation. A dark emptiness where souls are alone with HIM and his dread servants. All kinds of horrors will haunt the notorious sinners and will not leave them for a moment. There are some rumors all over the wastes that some were able to get into Hell live, and that this led to pure madness. Let this serve as a warning to us. Not everyone recognizes the existence of Hell, and among those who believe in it, there're still debate about whether it's eternal for the sinner, or he'll be given a chance for rebirth.<p/>
				The rest fall into the Primordial Chaos, where their soul completely and irrevocably disappears. They were neither righteous nor sinners, and their fate is to dissolve where they came from in the world. Some believe in reincarnation, as if those souls that fall into the Primordial Chaos are reborn in new bodies.
				<h3>Service</h3>
				Many priests use helium-3 and waste rods in rituals of religious service. The first symbolize the Old World, power, prosperity, abundance and grace, the second – the New World, disasters, poverty, devastation and sin. Helium was a gift from The One to humanity to create Heaven on Earth, waste is a burning curse for their sins and sacrilege, for people have defiled His help.<p/>
				For many cults, the artifact known as the Absolute Antidote Apple (or 3A.) is a most sacred relic due to its super-healing power, extreme rarity and impossibility of re-creation. It is believed that 3A. was personally created by The One as a gift for his most chosen servants before all mankind sinned. That's why it's called the Apple of The One.

				<h2>Society of Redemptionists</h2>
				People say that human beings are more evil than any folklore demon. The Event and the Last War clearly showed who is who. Redemptionists are a perfect example of what it's possible to reach, being a fanatic who does not appreciate life.<p/>
				Religious scholars divide the traditional cults of The One into three branches. Some who want to reach Heaven live mainly in villages of the Masked. People from the second group want to find paradise in H.I.V.E.s, they also partially contributed to the creation of Sanctuaries.<p/>
				But it's better not to meet anyone with the third group. They can tear anyone to shreds if they see a sinner in the victim. For them, the word of The One is an unquestionable law, and anyone who disagrees must be cleansed by fire.<p/>
				They believe that when the world is completely cleansed of sin, then The One will come, forgive them and restore Earth to its former glory. Cultists will do anything for this, so watch out.<p/>
				However, they aren't yet strong enough for humanity to know their mission, and their special religiosity has led to some form of insanity.
				<h3>Memories of the Last War</h3>
				The basis of this cult are veterans of the Last War or their descendants. They remember the horrors that the world has known, and they sincerely believe that all of humanity is guilty of what they have done.<p/>
				The very idea of hating everything and everyone was clearly not enough to promote the movement, so the Redemptionists included religion in their ideology.<p/>
				So far, they do not have enough forces for war with the "sinful" world, and their reputation leaves much to be desired. Until then, their cult is a secret society, where not everyone can find a way. 
				<h3>Where can they be found</h3>
				The Society of Redemptionists has many outposts where's military-strategic information about current situations in the world collected. However, the main bases of cults are asylums, where every exile, criminal or just offended by society can find "peace" here.
				<h3>Hierarchy of the cult</h3>
				Redemptionists are divided into three castes:<p/>
				<ul>
					<li>Scouts are the lowest. All newcomers are accepted there at the beginning. Their tasks include spying on a certain territory in outposts and fighting for the cult in the case of crusades.</li>
					<li>Workers are average. Full-fledged members of the society who work for its benefit. However, if anything happens, they are ready to take up arms.</li>
					<li>Scientists are the highest. Cult leaders, they are also the most formidable opponents who are able to use the latest wonders of technology based on Null-Engineering in battle.</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Holy crusades</h3>
				Members of the cult are angry at humanity, considering it the culprit of the Event and the Last War. They believe that cleansing the world with the blood of sinners is a God-pleasing thing, so for the sake of a sacred mission, they organize crusades to the settlements of survivors.<p/>
				Because of the peacefulness of the Masked, they become the favorite victim of these psychopaths. At the same time, their most formidable enemies are scavengers, famous for their resistance to inhuman conditions. In this case, a ritual was developed, called the Doctrine of Revenge, combining "business with pleasure".<p/>
				Among the scouts, both in walking patrols and in outposts, it's possible to find a captain by recognizing him by a flag with a cult symbol on his head. Each captain has a secret device that activates at the moment of death, and if the killer was a scavenger, then he picks up special mycelium spores with a tracking sensor. Fortunately, as in the case of potions, it can be disposed of with stoneback milk.
				However, if you came with this "bad omen" to the village of the Masked, then you are in trouble. Because of you, a holy cleansing crusade will begin against the village of civilians and you personally as revenge for the brothers. Now it remains to take your weapons and defend everyone.<p/>
				During the crusade, Redemptionists use the services of outcast mercenaries, former Masked, who were expelled and "presented" with a cone. Now their knowledge of alchemy will help to take revenge.<p/>
				But if you are so powerful that you managed to repel all their attacks, then the Masked will be incredibly grateful to you. They will mark you with a sign that you are the hero of the village, and everyone will see your valor!
