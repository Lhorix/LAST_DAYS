				<h2>Cults of The One</h2>
				Not everyone is ready to accept the harsh reality as it is. In this difficult time, many seek solace in religion. Among the Masked throughout the wastes, monotheistic cults of The One are most common.
				<h3>The One of Ancient Times</h3>
				The central figure around which the cults are built is The One of Ancient Times (or simply The One), all-powerful supreme God of all existence. Most believe that because of the sins of mankind, He heralded the End Times and turned away from people.
				<h3>Creation of the World</h3>
				People have always wanted to know where everything came from. Many cults consider such a myth to be true:<p/>
				<div class="record">
					In the beginning there was nothing, neither heaven nor earth, only silence and emptiness. Then The One spoke the Word that became the All-Source, also known as the Primordial Chaos from which He built the visible world.<p/>
					After the creation of the Universe, The One populated the Earth with humans, intelligent beings with souls from the All-Source. These souls allowed people to be people: to create, develop and invent new things.<p/>
					In the heavens above, The One raised His personal Realm, from where He looked at the Earth and rejoiced at the miracles that His children were doing.
				</div><p/>
				Knowing this legend, it is easy to understand why M.N.P. encoded files are the greatest value for cultists: they contain a code that corrects reality, and they believe that these books contain the words with which The One created the Universe.
				<h3>The Sin of mankind</h3>
				Most cults agree with the following myth called "The Sin of mankind". It says:<p/>
				<div class="record">
					The One once provided humanity with technology and shelter through the Industrial Station in His Realm in the Heavens above. But humanity grew greedy and desired the divine power. They attacked and defiled the source of technology shattering the Industrial Complex. The One grew angry upon this sacrilege and heralded The End Times by raining fire from the skies, smiting the unworthy.
				</div><p/>
				In reality, this legend is a mythological retelling of what partly happened in reality. The origins of this myth lie in "Golden" age (8 B.E.–0 A.E.), when traditional religiosity was increasingly fading. People already had everything thanks to Mr. History and his O.I. Of course, in the new world he will be considered a God. And the reason why the Event happened and humanity lost this paradise is quite primitive: punishment from above for grave sins. People remember the blissful times of prosperity and abundance, but this world was taken away from them. As they believe, The One has turned away from them, and believers will pray that He will return and forgive them.
				<h3>Types of cults</h3>
				There are several sects and churches with different views of what happened next and how the current situation should be bested. Three main branches:<p/>
				<ul>
					<li>Caelism (from Latin <i>caelum</i> 'heaven', 'sky'): those who're hoping to ascend to Heavens. They can usually be found in villages of the Masked;</li>
					<li>Hiveism: those who're hoping to find a paradise within a H.I.V.E. They're the ones who had a hand in creating the Sanctuaries.</li>
					<li>Redemptionism: those who believe that everyone is guilty and should be purged and killed with fire. They're not welcome in adequate societies, so they hide where no one can find them.</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Forgiveness</h3>
				Although The One has left humanity alone with its fate, many believe that one day He will forgive the world and make it a paradise, as it was originally conceived. When some pray incessantly in the circle of believers, others become missionaries who long for the whole world to begin to glorify The One. But there are also those who are eager to cleanse the world of all sinners. The essence is the same: The Ancient Times of humanity must return at any cost.
				<h3>Saints</h3>
				The One very rarely (almost never) answers the prayers of humanity. Believers rarely turn to Him and most often appeal to saints, those of people who, during their lifetime, devoted themselves to the service of The One of Ancient Times, were pious and virtuous (depending on moral standards) and were subsequently glorified by the cults of The One. Saints are an example of benefactor for all of us, some holidays are dedicated to some of them and some children are named after them.
				<h3>The One's Realm</h3>
				Cult myths say that The One once had His own realm, the Moon, from where He watched people and their development. Now, because of the sins of mankind, it is abandoned and split into pieces, and this can be clearly observed at night.<p/>
				<div class="record">
					The Moon was once the home of The One, a beautiful place of perfection and holiness filled with Light. From there He watched the growth of humanity together with the souls of the righteous who got there after death.<p/>
					When humanity, affected by the Second Great War, needed help most of all, The One built the Industrial Station in His Realm to help him. Through this Station, people received technologies and H.I.V.E., a safe shelter against any adversity.<p/>
					But humanity in abundance of everything craved more, they became more greedy. In an attempt to take the Industrial Complex into their own hands, they managed to destroy and desecrate it.<p/>
					This greatly angered The One, and He heralded The End Times. A fiery rain was falling from the sky, punishing sinners, and the Moon itself was destroyed for the edification of others. After that, The One left the Universe, settling together with the righteous souls in the new Heaven located in the Primordial Chaos. Only the pure in heart can find their way there.
				</div>
				<h3>HE, the nameless devil</h3>
				This myth is retold in a whisper, because few people want to talk about HIM.<p/>
				<div class="record">
					The fact that people have sinned against The One should be obvious to everyone, but we must understand that there is no limit to dishonor. Not just to defile His gifts, as many did then, but an attempt to take His place naturally entails heavy punishment. Be afraid of HIM, who tried to take the universe into his demonic power, and pray that HE does not come, so that no one will know the madness, horror and malice that HE carries.<p/>
					Once HE was a mere mortal, who harbored malice and a thirst for power. HE was cunning and very smart, and HE used the technologies provided by The One to seize power over existence. The Primordial Chaos from which The One created all things is the key to success. In this place HE built Hell, his personal world of damnation and horror, where HIS faithful servants were created.<p/>
					HE tried to usurp the sacred Industrial Station, but lost in this war and was locked up by The One in HIS realm. And so, HE howls into the void from anger and madness, looking for those fools who will help HIM return to the world.<p/>
					Pray to The One that this will NEVER happen! NEVER!
				</div>
				<h3>Afterlife</h3>
				As for life after death, it is traditionally considered as follows: good and righteous souls go to Heaven, evil and sinful souls go to Hell, others – to the Primordial Chaos from which The One created the Universe.<p/>
				Heaven is usually represented as a blooming beautiful garden, where there is no place for sin. Abundance of food, safety, peace and security are its characteristics. This world does not need the sun, for The One is the source of the Light of grace. People live there forever in eternal bliss and idyll.<p/>
				Hell, in turn, is a world of pure madness and damnation. A dark emptiness where souls are alone with HIM and his dread servants. All kinds of horrors will haunt the notorious sinners and will not leave them for a moment. There are some rumors all over the wastes that some were able to get into Hell live, and that this led to pure madness. Let this serve as a warning to us. There is still debate about whether Hell is eternal for the sinner, or he'll be given a chance for rebirth.<p/>
				The rest fall into the Primordial Chaos, where their soul completely and irrevocably disappears. They were neither righteous nor sinners, and their fate is to dissolve where they came from in the world. Some believe in reincarnation, as if those souls that fall into the Primordial Chaos are reborn in new bodies.

				<h2>Society of Redemptionists</h2>
				People say that human beings are more evil than any folklore demon. The Event and the Last War clearly showed who is who. Redemptionists are a perfect example of what it's possible to reach, being a fanatic who does not appreciate life.<p/>
				Religious scholars divide the traditional cults of The One into three branches. Some who want to reach Heaven live mainly in villages of the Masked. People from the second group want to find paradise in H.I.V.E.s, they also partially contributed to the creation of Sanctuaries.<p/>
				But it's better not to meet anyone with the third group. They can tear anyone to shreds if they see a sinner in the victim. For them, the word of The One is an unquestionable law, and anyone who disagrees must be cleansed by fire.<p/>
				They believe that when the world is completely cleansed of sin, then The One will come, forgive them and Earth and turn it into paradise, as it was originally conceived. Cultists will do anything for this, so watch out.<p/>
				However, they aren't yet strong enough for humanity to know their mission, and their special religiosity has led to some form of insanity.
				<h3>Memories of the Last War</h3>
				The basis of this cult are veterans of the Last War or their descendants. They remember the horrors that the world has known, and they sincerely believe that all of humanity is guilty of what they have done.<p/>
				The very idea of hating everything and everyone was clearly not enough to promote the movement, so the Redemptionists included religion in their ideology.<p/>
				So far, they do not have enough forces for war with the "sinful" world, and their reputation leaves much to be desired. Until then, their cult is a secret society, where not everyone can find a way. 
				<h3>Where can they be found</h3>
				The Society of Redemptionists has many outposts where's military-strategic information about current situations in the world collected. However, the main bases of cults are asylums, where every exile, criminal or just offended by society can find "peace" here.
				<h3>Hierarchy of the cult</h3>
				Redemptionists are divided into three castes:<p/>
				<ul>
					<li>Scouts are the lowest. All newcomers are accepted there at the beginning. Their tasks include spying on a certain territory in outposts and fighting for the cult in the case of crusades.</li>
					<li>Workers are average. Full-fledged members of the society who work for its benefit. However, if anything happens, they are ready to take up arms.</li>
					<li>Scientists are the highest. Cult leaders, they are also the most formidable opponents who are able to use the latest wonders of technology based on Null-engineering in battle.</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Holy crusades</h3>
				Members of the cult are angry at humanity, considering it the culprit of the Event and the Last War. They believe that cleansing the world with the blood of sinners is a God-pleasing thing, so for the sake of a sacred mission, they organize crusades to the settlements of survivors.<p/>
				Because of the peacefulness of the Masked, they become the favorite victim of these psychopaths. At the same time, their most formidable enemies are scavengers, famous for their resistance to inhumane conditions. In this case, a ritual was developed, called the Doctrine of Revenge, combining "business with pleasure".<p/>
				Among the scouts, both in walking patrols and in outposts, it's possible to find a captain by recognizing him by a flag with a cult symbol on his head. Each captain has a secret device that activates at the moment of death, and if the killer was a scavenger, then he picks up special mycelium spores with a tracking sensor. Fortunately, as in the case of potions, it can be disposed of with stoneback milk.
				However, if you came with this "bad omen" to the village of the Masked, then you are in trouble. Because of you, a holy cleansing crusade will begin against the village of civilians and you personally as revenge for the brothers. Now it remains to take your weapons and defend everyone.<p/>
				During the crusade, Redemptionists use the services of outcast mercenaries, former Masked, who were expelled and "presented" with a cone. Now their knowledge of alchemy will help to take revenge.<p/>
				But if you are so powerful that you managed to repel all their attacks, then the Masked will be incredibly grateful to you. They will mark you with a sign that you are the hero of the village, and everyone will see your valor!
