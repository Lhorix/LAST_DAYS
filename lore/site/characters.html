				"Last Days" characters list:
				<hr/>
				<h2>Dr. Hypophysos H. Crocopolous</h2>
				A mad scientist whose madness and thirst for power are the main reason for the Event.
				<h3>Croc Co.</h3>
				When Dr. Hypophysos H. Crocopolous was the chief of development, he was engaged in the study of Null-Space. The project he led was called "Croc Co.", whose goal is to understand and harness the power of Creation that permeates the Abyss. From now on, this has become the main dream of a madman.<p/>
				And all because of the death of his wife and that he was denied a experimental cyborg procedure to revive her. From that moment he started his game.<p/>
				At first, Dr. Crocopolous created Croc Co. Power Core, a V.B.T.W. binding device that allows teleportation. Then he charged them using helium-3 from the Moon and created a special interdimensional portal for them.<p/>
				And after that he faked the failure of Null-path experiments in order to create his secret personal world, Realm of Madness (R.o.M.). In this place Hypophysos conducted torturous cyborgization experiments on living people using those Power Cores as a spine. So the so-called Experiments appeared.
				<h3>Departure</h3>
				One such creature teleported into an O.I. office building and ripped appart it's foundation and column supports, killing two hundred office workers in the resulting collapse.<p/>
				After learning about this, Mr. History had initiated a company-internal inquiry against to Dr. Crocopolous because he suspected him off unethical work methods. This led to his departure.<p/>
				Dr. Crocopolous’s madness and a thirst for power over existence overshadowed his mind. Now there's nothing left to lose, he finally decided to carry out the cyborgization procedure on himself. Dr. Hypophysos H. Crocopolous is no longer a man, but a dragon-like machine, in other words, the Mad Dragon, single ruler of R.o.M.<p/>
				With the transformation, HE finally rejected humanness as something unnecessary. HIS madness went too far, and HE desired to become the one almighty god of all existence. HE tried to influence the Abyss so that the whole universe would become HIS kingdom, and HE would be a god of all existence.
				<h3>Punishment</h3>
				Something (or someone?) locked the Dragon in his realm, in the very center of it. Some say that his next "experiment" failed for natural reasons, others hint at the Divine will, but few talk about the intervention of aliens or some kind of creatures native to the Void. Who is right, no one knows. And so far he wants to break through to Earth, but the return portal does not work for HIM.<p/>
				Until now, HE is forever flying on the waves of emptiness in HIS new homeland, which has forever become HIS prison.
				<h3>Cause of the Event</h3>
				However, the damage has already been done. HIS actions resulted in incorrect operation of Null-Paths used in O.I. experimental Earth-Moon portal. This is what caused the Event, it is HE who is guilty of this.<p/>
				HE thinks to himself: well, at least some kind of revenge, since the world did not want to accept ME as the sole ruler of existence.<p/>
				If you are a believer, pray more often that HE will not return. Never.
				<hr/>
				<h2>Creeper</h2>
				The real name of Creeper is unknown to anyone, including himself. Despite this, he left his mark in the new post-war world.
				<h3>Illegal H.I.V.E.</h3>
				Judging by the miraculously preserved report on the illegal H.I.V.E., Creeper is his call sign when he was still an agent. His last assignment was to find the source of unknown portal signatures. As a result, he found an illegal H.I.V.E. and evidence that Dr. Hypophysos H. Crocopolous is experimenting on humans.<p/>
				It is not known how it happened (and he himself does not know, or is afraid to find out), but after that Creeper fell into the Realm of Madness, where he met HIM.
				<h3>Pure madness</h3>
				It is not known how long the Creeper was in this place, but one thing is obvious: this was the cause of his insanity and subsequent P.T.S.D.<p/>
				That creature seemed to be playing with him, with his dreams and his soul itself. HE told him that the Moon was destroyed because of HIM, let them suffer at least, since HE did not become the god of the entire universe.<p/>
				Subsequently, he got out of this horror. Again, it is unknown how, and it is better not to ask him about it ever. Seriously, it's not worth it.
				<h3>Back to reality</h3>
				Creeper woke up near that damn portal. Giant roaches had eaten almost all of his clothes and they were going to eat him. He escaped through the entire illegal H.I.V.E., where he found new clothes. On the way out, Creeper found a note to him. There it was said that the Last War had taken place and they would not search for him.<p/>
				He escaped from the H.I.V.E. to the surface, where, apparently, there was a nuclear war.
				<h3>Time system</h3>
				As Creeper was running through the H.I.V.E., his clock showing the year broke. Therefore, he had to come up with a new time system. It is based on the Event when the Moon was destroyed.<p/>
				So, Creeper, when he invented this time system, writing down everything that happened to him in his personal diary, designated the current day as March 16<sup>th</sup> 13 "after the Event" (A.E.). Accordingly, "before the Event" is designated as B.E.<p/>
				Subsequently, the B.E./A.E. calendar became popular among survivors.
				<h3>The ideal scavenger</h3>
				For many years, Creeper survived as best he could in this new world and trained.<p/>
				Later, on April 9<sup>th</sup> 16 A.E., he wrote the book "Poetry of Ruins", which tells about life hacks of survival, building a civilization and dreams of a bright future.<p/>
				This book brought him popularity and set the tone for the subculture of scavengers. From him came the tradition of using the BE/AE time system. He also set the fashion for nicknames instead of real names. In other words, he was the ideal for scavengers.<p/>
				However, Creeper himself was always an aloof and unsociable person, not everyone could find him. Some even ask: did he exist in reality?
				<h3>Respawn System</h3>
				In addition, Creeper developed an obsessive desire for immortality. However, who wouldn't refuse it in this hell?<p/>
				In the illegal H.I.V.E. there were still untouched records of experiments with Null-Space. For the sake of these treasures, Creeper had to overcome his P.T.S.D. for a while.<p/>
				Now the records were in his hands, it remained only to conduct his own research and experiments. And so, in 27 A.E., he finally managed to do what he called the "Respawn System".<p/>
				This system allowed him to resurrect himself without any problems. Of course, all his personal stuff got lost, stayed there, but that's not a problem, is it?<p/>
				This event gave rise to even more myths and rumors about this mysterious man. Does immortality really exist or is it a naive fable?
