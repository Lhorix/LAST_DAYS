				"Last Days" worlds list:
				<hr/>
				<h2>Prime universe</h2>
				<h3>Earth</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>Overworld</b></div><p/>
				A long time ago, in the good old days, Earth was a prosperous world where the grass was green, the sky was blue, and humanity predicted the coming of a bright utopian future.<p/>
				But the Event and the subsequent war changed the world forever, dividing it into "before" and "after". Now it is a nuclear dump filled with radiation, hunger and disease.<p/>
				Harsh Bandits, degraded Lost, and The Huggatrons that were once a symbol of the Old World's progress, now want to blow up everything and everyone – that's the New World's truth. The truth we'll have to come to terms with is that mankind have carelessly lost their greatness.<p/>
				Is there any hope that paradise lost will ever return?
				<h3>The Moon</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>The Nether</b></div><p/>
				Once the beautiful and sole satellite of Earth, the moon is a literal debris field in the orbit nowadays.<p/>
				After Orbital Industries' mining operations and underground weapon testing started to hollow it out, the Moon soon became nicknamed "The Belly".<p/>
				During the Event an experimental Moon portal sucked a fraction of Earth's atmoshpere into the Belly and set of a chain reaction of explosions. The Moon broke apart.<p/>
				The atmosphere on the Moon allows the transmission of soundwaves but isn't thick enough to sustain life (expect the Moonshroom).<p/>
				After the scientists that survived the Event in the Belly were stranded (as O.I. was disbanded and the nuclear war broke out) their sanity and bodies were twisted by their hazardous environment. The lack of maintenance threw mining and security robots into a state of disarray, making the Moon one of the most dangerous places to be. Even if you have a space suit on you to prevent suffocation.
				<hr/>
				<h2>Other dimensions</h2>
				<h3>Null-Space</h3>
				Beyond our native and familiar universe with three spatial dimensions, there is another place that some assume is the source of all existence that we see.<p/>
				Null-Space, also referred to as 0-Space, Void Between The Worlds (V.B.T.W.), Abyss of Damnation, is multidimensional plane of existence, filled with nothing but what scientists called "Raw Chaos".<p/>
				This void space was the main topic of Dr. Crocopolous's research. In the last years before the Event, he conducted experiments with hyperspace corridors called Null-Paths. After a while, these studies served as the basis for the building of O.I. experimental Moon portal that subsequently caused the Event.<p/>
				In 27 A.E. a scavenger scientist named Creeper, based on O.I. records of the Void experiments, has created a special system of resurrection which he called "Respawn System". The main point is that after the death of the bound user, the system reconstructs his body based on the template encoded in the fabric of Null-Space. The technology itself is expensive, so only a few can use it.<p/>
				After the Event, there were a lot of Null-Paths between Earth and the Moon left in the Void. Thanks to them, Moon portals can be easily constructed. They are also used to connect to the Respawn System via Moon Null Anchor (M.N.A.).<p/>
				Somewhere out there, in the depths of the Abyss, lies the Realm of Madness where HE resides…
				<h3>Realm of Madness</h3>
				<div class="greener">Minecraft counterpart: <b>The End</b></div><p/>
				This is the very place about which there are heated debates. Skeptics say that this is nothing more than a myth and a horror story, some believers call it Hell, where sinners fall. But those who know say: this place is real, and in a way it really is hell.<p/>
				Even in the O.I. sources, this place is called the Realm of Madness (R.o.M.), and that says something. This world is located in Void Between The Worlds, it's the realm of islands floating in an endless and gloomy emptiness, although at the same time there is a certain gravity "down".<p/>
				It is also said that the Realm of Madness is a result of experiments with teleportation gone wrong, resulting in a shattered dimension. Blessed are the ignorant, because everything was planned. Well, almost.<p/>
				This whole place is populated by Experiments, former humans, now manic cyborgs. They became so because of the disgusting unethical experiments conducted by Dr. Crocopolous. Just please, never look them in their eyes!<p/>
				But the main inhabitant and ruler of this realm is a Mad Dragon, called in fear by the pronoun "HE". Is anyone ready to meet HIM face to face?
